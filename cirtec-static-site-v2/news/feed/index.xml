					<description><![CDATA[<p>3635<em>The acquisition increases Cirtec’s presence in the structural heart and interventional markets.</em></p>
<p><strong>Minneapolis, MN</strong>—July 26, 2021 — Cirtec Medical Corporation, a strategic outsourcing partner of complex medical devices including minimally invasive and active implantable devices, today announced that it has acquired <a href="https://cardeacath.com/">Cardea Catheter Innovations</a>, a vertically integrated manufacturer of minimally invasive catheter devices and complex delivery systems based in San Jose, CA.</p>
<p>“We are excited to add Cardea Catheter Innovations to the Cirtec team,” stated Brian Highley, Cirtec CEO. “This acquisition is a natural fit for us and serves as another example of our commitment to building our interventional capabilities for our customers following our investments into Vascotube and NovelCath.”</p>
<p>Cardea will integrate within the NovelCath brand, contributing to Cirtec’s Interventional segment focusing on structural heart, electrophysiology, and neurovascular applications. With experience in design, development and manufacturing, Cardea specializes in highly engineered braided and coiled reinforced catheter shafts, complex steerable and multi-directional sheath designs, medical balloons and microcatheters.</p>
<p>Both the current Cirtec Los Gatos design center (<em>formerly Circle Medical</em>) and Cardea will be relocating to a new 32,000 sq. ft. purpose-built facility in San Jose, CA.  This facility will become Cirtec’s West Coast Center of Excellence for Catheters and Delivery Systems and will include catheter development, full device assembly, packaging, and volume manufacturing capabilities with a path to Cirtec Costa Rica production.  The move will add a substantial expansion of manufacturing space for Cardea.</p>
<p>Matyou Shahbaz, Cardea CEO and founder commented, “This is an excellent opportunity for our organization, employees and most importantly our customers.  We believe in Cirtec’s vision for this segment and core commitment to create value for our customers.  Joining Cirtec’s Interventional segment provides tremendous career opportunities for our team and enables us to support our customers with additional capabilities and competencies with a very experienced Cirtec team.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>3644<em>The System’s PMA has been converted to a Device Master File (MAF) that will be made available to customers to support their development of new neuromodulation therapies. </em></p>
<p><strong>Minneapolis, MN</strong>—February 1, 2021 — Cirtec Medical Corporation, a strategic outsourcing partner for complex medical devices including active implantables, minimally invasive devices and novel catheter-based delivery systems, today announced a sponsor-initiated withdrawal of the premarket approval (PMA) for the Nuvectra Algovita Spinal Cord Stimulation System.  The System was an FDA and CE Mark approved neurostimulation system with no open field actions at the time of acquisition.  The withdrawal of the PMA and subsequent creation of the Device Master File aligns with Cirtec’s strategy to support Academic, Research and Commercial partners with design, development, and manufacturing of active implantable device.</p>
<p>Brian Highly, Cirtec CEO stated, “We are pleased to provide this technology to our neuromodulation development partners. It demonstrates our commitment to serve as the leading end-to-end outsource partner in the neuromodulation market and will help to accelerate our customers’ time to market and minimize development spend.“</p>
<p>The announcement comes nine months after Cirtec acquired intellectual property and certain assets from Nuvectra Corporation with the goal of enhancing their SIMPLIFI™ Neuromodulation Solutions Platform.  Cirtec will not commercialize the platform, instead they will leverage this technology to support customers’ development of neuromodulation systems, with a complete Device Master File (MAF) that can be referenced by Cirtec customers for a variety of therapeutic applications.</p>
<p>Prof. Greg Molnar, PhD, University of Minnesota Medical School &#38; MnDRIVE, MDIC Fellow, AIMBE Fellow commented, “Translating neuromodulation research concepts in academia just became much easier. Having access to Cirtec’s ‘SIMPLIFI’ clinical neurostimulation system and Master File can be leveraged to support physician-sponsored IDE studies that would otherwise not be possible.”</p>
<p>“Leveraging Cirtec’s SIMPLIFI Neuromodulation Platform has enabled Comphya to significantly reduce our cost and time to market by leveraging the existing validation reports and other objective evidence rather than creating our own,” said Cirtec customer, Rodrigo Fraga, CEO of Comphya. <strong> </strong></p>

The addition of these facilities is part of Cirtec’s strategic plan to support current and future partners.</p>
<p>The new, state-of-the-art facility will become the company’s Neuromodulation Center of Excellence and focus on active implantable device manufacturing and clean room assembly of neuromodulation leads, implantable pulse generators (IPGs) and accessories. In addition, it will allow for expanded engineering competencies in mechanical, process, quality, electrical engineering, software, firmware and testing. Other capabilities will include silicone injection molding, plastic injection molding, final packaging and ethylene oxide sterilization.  This facility would expand the company’s presence in Minnesota, and underscores Cirtec’s ongoing commitment and investment in the area’s medical device industry and local job market.</p>
<p>Brian Highley, Cirtec CEO commented, “This is an exciting time for Cirtec. However our continued growth has created some real challenges with space.  The new site and the addition of our Costa Rica facility are a necessary part of ensuring we have the capacity to support our customer’s growth over the longer term.”</p>
<p>Construction on the new facility is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2020, with completion targeted in the second half of the year. The existing Brooklyn Park facility will become an all metals component and sub-assemblies facility, focusing on Swiss machining, milling, stamping, coil winding, laser cutting and welding, and nitinol processing.</p>

<h3>COMPHYA SA ANNOUNCES PARTNERSHIP WITH CIRTEC MEDICAL CORP. ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIRST IMPLANTABLE NEUROSTIMULATOR TO TREAT ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION.</h3>
<p>Lausanne, Switzerland, October 25th, 2019. <a href="https://comphya.com/">Comphya SA</a>, a developer of a novel implantable neurostimulator to treat erectile dysfunction in non-responders to oral drugs, today announced a strategic development and manufacturing relationship with Cirtec Medical Corporation.</p>
<p>This partnership will lead to the system development of CaverSTIM, the first implantable neurostimulator to treat Erectile Dysfunction. Cirtec Medical will design and develop the complete system including the implantable pulse generator and the electrode paddle for Comphya, via access to the unique, Solace™ implantable neurostimulation platform. As a result, Comphya will reduce technology risks and time-to-market. “We are delighted to be working with a highly professional and outstanding Cirtec team”; Founder Professor Nikos Stergiopulos added.</p>
<p>The development of CaverSTIM started on Q2.2019 when our agreement between Comphya and Cirtec Medical was signed. Recently, the first prototypes have been built and the complete system is expected to be ready for first-in-human on Q2.2020. Steve Swinson, Chairman, commented “We have a unique solution that can help ED patients and our partnership with Cirtec is very important to finalize faster our solution to start our pilot clinical trials in 2020”.</p>
<p>Cirtec Medical is a leading provider of outsourced medical device design, engineering, and manufacturing. For over 30 years, the Company offers outsourced solutions for complex medical devices by offering a uniquely comprehensive range of resources and expertise including the design and manufacturing of neuromodulation, drug delivery, cardiac rhythm management, mechanical circulatory support, and minimally invasive surgical devices. “Cirtec is excited to partner with Comphya to bring this unique therapy to market”, says Brian Highley, CEO of Cirtec Medical</p>
<p>“We are excited to be partnering with a leading manufacturer in neuromodulation, which will enhance our ability and reduce the time to serve better ED patients”, said Rodrigo Fraga-Silva, CEO of Comphya.</p>
<p><strong>About CaverSTIM</strong></p>
<p>CaverSTIM is a neurostimulator to be implanted in the pelvic cavity, which will activate and restore the neuronal path for penile erection. The technology consists of transmitting by radio frequency operating instructions to the implantable unit, using an external control unit. The system includes two paddle leads with 12 electrodes each and connect to an Implanted Pulse Generator (IPG) to deliver electrical stimulation.  The IPG is wirelessly programmed using a Clinician Programmer Application to enable the appropriate sets of electrodes and program the stimulation pulse sequence. The patient is able to turn stimulation on/off, adjust the amplitude or select pre-defined stimulation pulse sequences using a Patient Remote Control.  The IPG is periodically recharged using the external wireless Charger</p>
<p><strong>About Comphya SA</strong></p>
<p>Comphya is developing a novel implantable device to restore the erectile function in patients non-responsive to oral drugs (e.g. Viagra), particularly, spinal cord injury and post-prostatectomy patients. Today, these patients resort to intrapenial injections or penile implants, which are the only available yet painful, problematic and outdated therapies.</p>
<p>Comphya’s patented solution is based on neuroprosthetic principles and offers a unique and superior treatment for ED. The system stimulates the cavernosal nerve (pro-erectile nerve) via wireless external controllers, to restore natural penile erection. The company’s goal is to offer physiological sexual function and quality of life to large parts of the male population in great need.</p>
<p>The company is a spin-off from the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) that emerged from the research group of Prof. Nikos Stergiopulos, at EPFL (https://lhtc.epfl.ch),/ one of the most active and successful academic labs developing medical technology from the lab bench to the clinic. For more information, visit: www.comphya.com</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p><em>Acquisition enhances Cirtec’s implantable device platform and further advances their strategy for acquiring value-added capabilities and services.</em></p>
<p>Cirtec Medical Corporation, a leading provider of design and contract manufacturing services for complex medical devices including active implants and minimally invasive surgical devices, today announced that it acquired <a href="http://www.cactussemiconductor.com/">Cactus Semiconductor</a>, a full-service provider of low-power, mixed-signal application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) specializing in miniaturized portable and implantable medical devices.</p>
<p>Today’s medical ASICs are used in implantable medical devices aimed at providing therapy for a number of conditions, from pain management to epilepsy and psychological disorders. Medical integrated circuits (ICs) can be used in devices programmed to deliver drugs on a more effective schedule to effectively treat and relieve patient’s conditions with fewer side effects. And because implantable devices need to be small, lightweight, and use less power, medical ICs help meet the necessary requirements for medical device integration.</p>
<p>Brian Highley, CEO of Cirtec Medical, said, “Cactus Semiconductor has a proven track record of providing world-class ASIC products, developed by a talented team of engineers and design experts. Through this acquisition, we will be able to provide a broader product portfolio and deliver a complete solution to our customers.”</p>
<p>Founded in 2002, Cactus Semiconductor has brought numerous system-level analog and mixed signal ASICs for low-power battery-operated electronics to market. The company is ISO9001:2015 certified, and will remain in their Chandler, AZ facility. Their current COO, Nandini Srinivasan, and President, James McDonald, will remain with the company.</p>
<p>“This acquisition is a great fit for our company, given Cirtec’s strong implantable device expertise,” said James McDonald, President of Cactus Semiconductor. “We are excited to be a part of this transition and look forward to partnering with the Cirtec team and expanding our capabilities to a larger customer base.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Cirtec expands internationally through the acquisition and increases capabilities with precision-engineered nitinol tube technology.</em></p>
<p><strong>Minneapolis, MN</strong>—December 4, 2017 — Cirtec Medical LLC, a leading provider of design and contract manufacturing services for implantable and minimally invasive surgical devices, today announced that it acquired Vascotube Gmbh, a leading manufacturer of high quality nitinol tubing, located in Birkenfeld, Germany.</p>
<p>Founded in 2004, Vascotube processes nitinol tubing used in minimally invasive implantable medical devices. Nitinol’s properties of superelasticity and unique shape memory capabilities make it an ideal material for use in scaffold-like medical devices, such as peripheral and vascular stents, replacement heart valves, and embolic protection filters, that are compressed, inserted into the body intravenously and then expanded to pre-set shapes. Vascotube’s proprietary manufacturing process and focus on quality has made it a leading provider in its target markets and with its customers.</p>
<p>“Vascotube complements our capabilities to include precision nitinol tube drawing,” said Brian Highley, CEO of Cirtec. “It also expands our geographic footprint into Europe and further diversifies Cirtec’s exposure to a broad range of highly attractive and rapidly growing therapeutic categories with industry leading customers and products. We are thrilled to be adding a new set of highly differentiated capabilities to offer our customers.”</p>
<p>Uwe Seiler, Managing Director, Vascotube added, “We are happy to have found a strong partner in Cirtec that can help us grow our sales footprint and better support our customers. The Cirtec and Vascotube offerings are highly complementary and focus on quality, high-end technical products and solutions that are customized to serve the critical needs of our customers. We are excited about the next chapter of growth that can be achieved by partnering with Cirtec.”</p>
<p>This acquisition aligns with Cirtec’s strategy to vertically integrate and expand its capabilities within minimally invasive interventional therapies. The combined business will have enhanced capabilities across components and fully assembled devices allowing Cirtec to better serve its customers. Vascotube’s current management team will remain in their current leadership roles with the company and the company will be become ‘Vascotube, A Cirtec Company’.093</p>
